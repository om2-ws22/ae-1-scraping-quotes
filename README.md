# Application exercise template 

Use this repo to insert your code.

**Important notes:**

- Activate the correct conda environment before you start.

- Make sure you fill in any place that says `YOUR CODE HERE` or "YOUR ANSWER HERE", as well as your name and (if necessary) collaborators below.

- The function `NotImplementedError()` prevents you from hand in assignments with empty cells. Simply delete the function if you start working on a cell with this entry.

- Before you turn this problem in (i.e., after you completed all tasks), make sure everything runs as expected: Restart the kernel and run all cells:
  - in *Jupyter Notebook*: in the menubar, select `Kernel` and click on `Restart & Run All`
  - in *Visual Studio Code*: select "Restart" and then "Run All" 

Good luck!
